# Experimental Theatre Digital Program - Project Plan

## 1. Project Goal

To create a digital program for an experimental theatre piece that involves:
1.  Automatically collecting images of audience faces from an SD card inserted into `computer1`.
2.  Processing these images on `computer1` to detect and crop out eyes.
3.  Serving a web-based visual client from `computer1` to `computer2` (which can only run a web browser).
4.  The client on `computer2` will display the processed eye images in real-time.
5.  Upon a keyboard shortcut trigger from `computer1`, the client on `computer2` will transition to a dynamic 3D animation using `Three.js`, where pre-loaded images form a flowing, sphere-like digital creature.

## 2. Overall Architecture

The system will operate with two computers in the same local network:

*   **`computer1` (Windows):** Acts as the central processing unit and server.
    *   Handles all image acquisition from the SD card.
    *   Performs image processing (eye detection and cropping).
    *   Hosts the web server (Flask) that serves the client application.
    *   Manages real-time communication (Flask-SocketIO) with the client.
    *   Listens for a local keyboard shortcut to trigger the main animation.
*   **`computer2` (Any OS with a modern Web Browser):** Acts as a display client.
    *   Loads and runs a web application served by `computer1`.
    *   Cannot run any native code; all logic is client-side JavaScript.
    *   Receives data and signals from `computer1` to update visuals.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Backend (`computer1` - Python):**
    *   **SD Card Detection & File Operations:** `psutil` (for drive detection), `os`, `shutil`.
    *   **Image Processing:** `OpenCV-Python` (for face/eye detection), `Pillow` (for image manipulation).
    *   **Folder Monitoring:** `watchdog`.
    *   **Web Framework:** `Flask`.
    *   **Real-time Communication:** `Flask-SocketIO`.
    *   **Keyboard Listener:** `keyboard` library.
    *   **Dependency Management:** `pip` with `requirements.txt`.
*   **Frontend (`computer2` - Browser, code served from `computer1`):**
    *   **Structure:** HTML5.
    *   **Styling:** CSS3.
    *   **Logic & Interactivity:** JavaScript (ES6+).
    *   **3D Graphics:** `Three.js`.
    *   **Real-time Communication Client:** `Socket.IO Client JS library`.
    *   **Image Display/Filtering (Optional):** HTML Canvas API.

## 4. Component Breakdown

### 4.1. Computer 1: Backend & Server (Python)

#### 4.1.1. SD Card Monitor & Image Importer
*   **Objective:** Detect SD card insertion and copy new images.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Periodically scan for newly connected drives/volumes using `psutil`.
    *   Identify the SD card (e.g., by volume name or presence of a specific marker file/folder).
    *   Once detected, iterate through image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) on the SD card.
    *   Copy only new images (not previously imported) to a designated `data/originals/` folder on `computer1`. Maintain a list or mechanism to track imported files.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/sd_card_monitor.py` (can be a standalone script or a module integrated into `main_server.py`).

#### 4.1.2. Eye Detection & Cropping Service
*   **Objective:** Process images from `data/originals/` to extract eyes.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Use `watchdog` to monitor the `data/originals/` folder for new image files.
    *   For each new image:
        *   Load the image using `OpenCV`.
        *   Perform face detection (e.g., using Haar cascades or a more modern DNN model).
        *   For each detected face, perform eye detection.
        *   Crop the regions corresponding to the detected eyes.
        *   Save the cropped eye images to the `data/cropped_eyes/` folder (e.g., `eye_timestamp_1.jpg`, `eye_timestamp_2.jpg`).
        *   After processing, notify the web server (e.g., via an internal queue or a Socket.IO emit from the server itself) that new eye images are available.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/image_processor.py` (can be a standalone script or a module).

#### 4.1.3. Web Application Server (Flask)
*   **Objective:** Serve the client application and image data.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Initialize Flask and Flask-SocketIO.
    *   Define a route to serve the main `index.html` for the client.
    *   Define routes to serve static assets (CSS, client-side JS, `Three.js` library, `Socket.IO` client library, and images in `static/other_images_for_animation/`).
    *   Define a route or mechanism to serve images from the `data/cropped_eyes/` folder (e.g., `/eyes/<filename>`).
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/main_server.py`.

#### 4.1.4. Real-time Communication (Flask-SocketIO)
*   **Objective:** Facilitate communication between server and client.
*   **Tasks (within `main_server.py`):**
    *   Handle client connections and disconnections.
    *   When the `image_processor.py` signals that new eye images are ready:
        *   Emit a `new_eye_image_available` event to all connected clients, sending the path/URL of the new eye image(s).
    *   When the `keyboard_listener.py` detects the trigger shortcut:
        *   Emit a `trigger_final_animation` event to all connected clients.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/main_server.py`.

#### 4.1.5. Keyboard Shortcut Listener
*   **Objective:** Detect a global keyboard shortcut on `computer1` to trigger the animation.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Use the `keyboard` library to listen for a specific key combination (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+T).
    *   When the combination is detected, send a signal to the `main_server.py` (e.g., via an internal HTTP request to a specific Flask endpoint, or by directly calling a function if running in the same process/thread, or via a shared event queue). The server will then relay this as a Socket.IO event.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/keyboard_listener.py` (standalone script).

### 4.2. Computer 2: Web Client (Browser, served from `computer1`)

#### 4.2.1. HTML Structure & Asset Loading
*   **Objective:** Basic webpage structure.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create `index.html` with placeholders for dynamic content.
    *   Include `<script>` tags for `Socket.IO` client, `Three.js`, and custom `client.js`.
    *   Include `<link>` tag for `style.css`.
    *   Container elements for eye image display and the Three.js canvas.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/templates/index.html`.

#### 4.2.2. Real-time Communication Client (Socket.IO JS)
*   **Objective:** Connect to the server and handle events.
*   **Tasks (within `client.js`):**
    *   Establish a Socket.IO connection to `computer1`'s server.
    *   Listen for `new_eye_image_available` events:
        *   On event, receive image URL/path.
        *   Call functions to display the new eye image.
    *   Listen for `trigger_final_animation` events:
        *   On event, call functions to initiate the Three.js animation sequence.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/static/js/client.js`.

#### 4.2.3. Eye Image Display
*   **Objective:** Show incoming eye images.
*   **Tasks (within `client.js`):**
    *   Function to dynamically add new eye images to the display area (e.g., append `<img>` tags or draw to a 2D canvas).
    *   Implement logic for how images are displayed (e.g., one by one, fading in/out, grid).
    *   Optional: Apply client-side filters using the Canvas API if desired.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/static/js/client.js`.

#### 4.2.4. Three.js Animation Engine
*   **Objective:** Create and manage the 3D animation.
*   **Tasks (within `client.js` or a dedicated `animation.js` module):**
    *   **Scene Setup:**
        *   Initialize Three.js scene, camera, renderer.
        *   Load the "other images" (from `computer1_backend/static/other_images_for_animation/`) as textures for 3D meshes.
        *   Position these meshes initially (e.g., scattered, semi-transparent).
    *   **Animation Logic:**
        *   Function to be called on `trigger_final_animation` event.
        *   Animate meshes blending/morphing into a sphere-like structure.
        *   Animate this structure flowing or moving across the screen.
        *   Handle the render loop.
*   **File:** `computer1_backend/static/js/client.js` (or potentially a separate JS file imported by it).

## 5. Data Management

*   **Source Images (SD Card):** Temporarily accessed.
*   **Originals:** Stored in `Program/computer1_backend/data/originals/`. Copied from SD card.
*   **Cropped Eyes:** Stored in `Program/computer1_backend/data/cropped_eyes/`. Generated by `image_processor.py`. Served to the client.
*   **Animation Assets:** Stored in `Program/computer1_backend/static/other_images_for_animation/`. Pre-loaded images for the Three.js animation. Served to the client.
