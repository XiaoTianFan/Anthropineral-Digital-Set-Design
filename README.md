**🌊 Flow Dynamics Features:**
- **⚖️ Balanced vs Simple Attraction**: Two distinct modes with intelligent force distribution
  - **Balanced Mode**: Prevents any single shape from monopolizing particles by reducing dominant attractor influence
  - **Simple Mode**: Direct inverse-square law attraction for dramatic clustering effects
- **🌀 Circulation Forces**: Makes particles flow **around** shapes in tangential motion rather than just toward them
- **🛡️ Repulsion Zones**: Creates dynamic "bubbles" around shapes preventing particle trapping and belt formation
- **💨 Global Flow Field**: Provides animated background "current" using noise-based flow for continuous organic motion
- **🌪️ Smart Turbulence**: Adds natural randomness and organic movement patterns with configurable intensity
- **⚡ Escape Velocity**: Allows fast particles to break free from attractor influence and explore other regions
- **💥 Dispersion Burst**: Dramatic explosive outward particle fountain with uniform distribution in all directions
- **🛡️ Shell Formation**: Particles form protective shell around converged shapes with dynamic stabilization forces
